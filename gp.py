# An geometric progression is a sequence of n numbers which have a same common ratio.
# For example [2, 4, 8, 16] is GP with common ratio 2 and [9, 3, 1] is an GP with common ratio 1/3. [2, 5, 6, 8] is not GP since it does not have same common ratio between all the terms.

# Given are 4 integers an, a1, n, k where an represent the n- th tern of AP with n denoting the number of terms and a1 is the first term.

# The task is to find the value of common difference and the k- th term of the given GP.

# Output the common difference upto two decimal places.
